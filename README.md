# segsimflex

This package (website: https://rezonators.github.io/segsimflex/index.html) aims to calculate a flexible segmentation similarity measure and a corresponding inter-annotator agreement score (between two annotators). It is currently under development. This score is similar to lexical edit distance (Fournier & Inkpen 2013), but can evaluate similarity between two segmentations of the same text with multiple, mutually exclusive boundary types, and also account for varying identifiability and confusability between boundary types.
